I am an undergraduate student at MIT and I'm interested in computer science and cryptography. I contribute to [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin). I was previously a student researcher at the [MIT Digital Currency Initiative](https://dci.mit.edu/people#:~:text=Ishaana%20Misra). I also co-founded [Generation Bitcoin](http://twitter.com/GenBitcoiners).
